# Build a ToDo App

### How the app works
This project serves as an online ToDo App, allowing the user to add items into localStorage while also displaying them in the UI. The user can remove an item via radio, which also removes it from localStorage. The list items remaining in localStorage will continue to be displayed when the user reloads the page. The <i>main</i> branch works as described, while the <i>secondary</i> branch retains the same functions but gets data from an API if localStorage is initially empty.

The challenge for this project was navigating the use of localStorage as it was my first time accessing it. The concept itself was straightforward, but I had ran into issues with storing and getting the objects in the array for specific use.

### Project Goals
Be able to add/delete list item from UI and localStorage, save each item as an object with text and id keys, apply JSON stringify and parse

### Technologies used
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, APIs
